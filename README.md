Creating an automatic street light project using IoT involves using a microcontroller, sensors, and possibly some communication modules. 
Here's a simple implementation using an Arduino microcontroller and a light-dependent resistor (LDR) to control the street lights.
Components:
Arduino (any model)
Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
Resistor (10k ohm)
LED (representing the street light)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Circuit:
Connect the LDR to the analog pin A0 on the Arduino, with one leg connected to 5V and the other leg connected to A0 and a 10k ohm resistor to GND.
Connect the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino through a 220-ohm resistor to GND.
IoT Integration:
To integrate IoT functionality, you can use a Wi-Fi module like the ESP8266 or the built-in Wi-Fi capabilities of an ESP32.
This allows you to monitor and control the street lights remotely. Here's a simple example using an ESP8266:
Additional Components:
ESP8266 Wi-Fi module (or use an ESP32)
Replace "your_SSID" and "your_PASSWORD" with your Wi-Fi credentials.
The ESP8266's analog pin reads values from 0 to 1023. You may need to adjust the threshold based on your specific LDR and environment.
This project can be expanded with additional features like remote control, scheduling, or integration with other IoT platforms.
